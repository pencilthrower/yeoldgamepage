                    <center><p>Rock–paper–scissors (also known as scissors-paper-rock or other variants) is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air. A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other</p></center>

                    <h1>Dice Game</h1>
                    <center><p>Craps is a dice game in which the players make wagers on the outcome of the roll, or a series of rolls, of a pair of dice. Players may wager money against each other (playing "street craps", also known as "shooting dice" or "rolling dice") or a bank (playing "casino craps", also known as "table craps", or often just "craps"). Because it requires little equipment, "street craps" can be played in informal settings.To start a round, the shooter makes a "come out" roll. A come out roll of 2, 3 or 12 is called "craps" and is an immediate loss. A come out roll of 7 or 11 is a "natural", and is an immediate win. The other possible rolls are called the “point” numbers: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. If the shooter rolls one of these numbers on the come out roll, this establishes the "point", and the point number must be rolled again before a seven on subsequent rolls in order to win.</p></center>
